In addition to Carly, we have developed the Midori AI Subsystem, a modular and extensible platform designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and management of AI workloads. The Subsystem leverages Docker container technology to provide standardized environments for AI systems, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior. Key features include:

* **Simplified Deployment:** Easily deploy AI systems using pre-configured containers, reducing complexity, and setup time.
* **Standardized Configurations:** Ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments with standardized configurations.
* **Isolation for AI Systems:** Isolate AI systems within containers, preventing conflicts and ensuring resource allocation.
* **Growing Library of Backends and Tools:** Access a wide range of supported AI backends and tools, expanding your AI capabilities.
